* It's really new trick that I should go back to to
*  It's all about using the concept of prefix & postfix arrays
*  to reduce the space complexity here, instead of using two different arrays for calculating prefix & postfix values, I have user two seperated loops
*  the first one for calculating the prefixt and append them to the result array
*  and the second one, for:
*   Calculate the postfix of each item in array
*   And then multuply those values to the result array to acheive the required output
