* the problem here is when I was thinkinh on a solution, the first approach come up to my mind is using **int()** and **str()** built-in functions and without caring on **edge cases**,  and this is so wrong on problem solving.
* I should first think smart, without the help of built-in functions, and make attention on details(edge cases) and figur out the I can add 1 to the last digit on the array
* Think smaaaaaaart

1. Iterate and turn each num to string
2. concatinate all of numbers(strings)
3. turn it to integer and increment by one
