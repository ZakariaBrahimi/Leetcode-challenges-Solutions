### The optimal approach:
```
- stack = []
- Looping through the given string
- if stack is not empty and s[i] == stack[-1]
- pop the last item of the stack
- else:
- push s[i] to the stack
- Returning the stack joined togather
```

* **Time Complexity:**  the length of the given string, so it's O(n)
* **Space Complexity:**  the length of the stack used, so it's O(n)
