 - We can improve our approach based on the **time complexity** of the solution, as we start with a **naive solution** which is **O(n2)**, and then we can **sort** the array, so we can go to **O(N log N)** by using **binary search**, and the **optimal solution** is using **two pointers** which are **O(n)**.
**In conclusion**: O(n2) => O(nlog) => O(n)
