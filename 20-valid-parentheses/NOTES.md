* The Balanced Parentheses Problem - Classic Stack Problem
* The way that solved has never changed because of there are only three types of parentheses which are **" ( + { + [ "**
* The time complexity of this approach is O(n) which the length of given string.
* The best case for space complexity is O(1) in case the first characer in the given string is closing bracket
* The everege case for space complexity is O(n/2) in case the **(((()))** On/2) == O(n) because we don't care about constant.
* The best case for space complexity is O(n) in case **((((((**
