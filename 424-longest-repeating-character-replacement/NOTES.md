* To simplify it and make the code more effectient:
```
class Solution:
def characterReplacement(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
count = {}
res = 0
â€‹
l = 0
maxf = 0
for r in range(len(s)):
count[s[r]] = 1 + count.get(s[r], 0)
maxf = max(maxf, count[s[r]]) # the logic here is simple, just walk through it with some examples
# keep shifting the left pointer if the sub-string is not valid
while (r - l + 1) - maxf > k:
count[s[l]] -= 1
l += 1
# the last while loop give us a valid sub-string -> so take the length of it.
res = max(res, r - l + 1)
return res
```
